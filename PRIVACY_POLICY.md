# Privacy Policy for HID-HOP

**Last Updated: December 2, 2025**

## Overview

HID-HOP ("the App") is developed by Nathan Brewer. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Data Collection

**HID-HOP does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The App operates entirely on your device and communicates only with your HID-HOP USB dongle via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## What the App Does

- Scans for nearby HID-HOP dongles via Bluetooth
- Connects to your dongle to send keyboard, mouse, and media commands
- Stores your preferences (sensitivity settings, haptic feedback) locally on your device

## What the App Does NOT Do

- Collect personal information
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or files
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Display advertisements

## Bluetooth Usage

The App requires Bluetooth permission to discover and communicate with your HID-HOP dongle. This connection is direct between your iPhone and the dongle - no data passes through any external servers.

## Local Storage

The App stores your preferences (such as touchpad sensitivity) using iOS's standard UserDefaults system. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

HID-HOP does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.
